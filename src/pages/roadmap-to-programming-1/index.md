I started around September 2015, things had already reach a turning point in Venezuelan politics and if you were not producing dollars you would find yourself pretty much incapable of going out and do anything for more than a couple days a month. This is not an exaggeration. At the time of this article the basic salary is around 5 dollars a month if you have an incredible job you make 300 tops.

So, after a few days of analysis I sat down at my Intel Celeron Asus computer with barely 4GB of RAM and started investigating how could I become a programmer. I needed a job that I could do from Venezuela so that I could make enough money to leave it. Around that same time many MOOCs were getting lots of traction on the web, and programming courses were popping all over the internet. So I said why not, lets see how complicated this can be. Well its like getting into a food court it all looks good and they all sell fast shit but you always leave with something missing.

Learning programming is hard, not because it requires you to be intelligent, but because it takes time and dedication. So if you are planning on getting on in the programming money wagon you better strap on for some time consuming mental exercising.

### So first things first, **where do you start?**

It all will depend of your personality. But, if you can manage to stick to one course and do every single thing they say, I would recommend starting out with [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). [Codecademy](http://codecademy.com/learn) is another very valid option but they ask for money for their more thorough training. [Bento](http://www.bento.io) is another great website I found to start, they have very detailed information on the whole subject and a curriculum. Those would be my first recommendations if you are the consistent, fast learner that wants to get hands on experience.

If you are a slow, intelectual learner that wants to sip everything around the subject of computation and get lost in its vast sea; then I would recommend [OSS University](https://ossu.firebaseapp.com/#/); it stands for Open Source Society University. They have an incredibly detailed curriculum for people that want to attain a Computer Science degree level education.

For those like me that get bored easily but want to learn everything, I would recommend to take a look at this list: [THE LIST](https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md). It is a compendium of books and tutorials on all things computational. It has resources for math, complexity analysis, every programming language that is popular enough to have open source books, and a lot more.

So, to start, get used to what those courses provide you and you will be on the starting line. Yes, after all those hours you will dedicate to learning you will be at the starting line of this industry, not even internship worthy for the first few months. Why? Because you have to be able to jump in the production line ready to produce.

### Second things to learn then?

After you can make a website with HTML, CSS and Javascript or you have managed to make a simple terminal console game with Ruby or even built a SPA with Ruby on Rails you will need to learn the ropes of working inside of the industry. So this is when you have to start thinking in things like workflows. To be productive in programming you need a fast workflow and that comes with knowing how to use the tools at your disposal.

The tools that I use:

*   A text editor, I use SublimeText and Vim they are powerful and unobtrusive. Avoid the IDEs they lead to dependency.
*   I use Hyper terminal simulator because I'm a sucker for good design and pretty things but you can use anything.
*   Python, ruby, pearl, C, C++, Haskell, Go, Clojure & node are the languages that I have installed in my computer. You don't have to know them all or use them at all but there are great tools built in different languages and I like to have a swiss army knife for a computer.
*   Git, is indispensable and knowing source control will become one of the paramounts for you employability.
*   Google Chrome (It sounds silly but it has the largest suit of plugins available for development which will make you life easier. I use at least 10 extension for finding fonts, colors, HTML elements structure, etc).
*   Sketch is the best thing you could use for web design.
*   Subscribe to Medium if you haven't yet you can learn so much from other developers its absurd. I consider it one of my tools because I solve many questions with it.
*   For precise doubts you should use StackOverflow which is the programmers encyclopedia. If you ever post a question there (which should be incredibly difficult due to the amount of answers that already exist) there is a format for that. You should post the logs of all the information related to your problem and the code that you have written so far. There are guidelines in the internet anyway.
*   To learn new things I use [Egghead](https://egghead.io/), [Pluralsight](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/) (that have free 3 months after opening a VisualStudio account) & [FrontEnd Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/). So far the most efficient courses aggregators I have found on web development.

So that's just for tooling and courses. If you are feeling it's too much that's because it is. At least at the beginning, you get used to learning fast because there is a pattern to how tools work in general so just dive right in and dedicate as much time as you can.

This is my personal 3 part series on becoming a programmer. You can find a lot of this out there so I just wanted to provide my personal one. Hope you found it helpful.

Have a good one.
