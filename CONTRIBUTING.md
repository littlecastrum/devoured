The current blog is being develop for personal interest and with the objective to return part of the knowledge 
that the web have provided me. Any person interested in helping me expand the quality of the blog is openly invited
and is free to contact me personally to expand the scope and collaborators on the blog.

The only current rules for collaboration is that the blog have to be tech related. I suspect it won't happen but if
you are reading this it means you were curious so you are welcome to change things around since I would love some help
like anyone else, besides that. Have a good one, and thanks for the effort of comming here. :)
